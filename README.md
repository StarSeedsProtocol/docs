# Intro to StarSeeds Protocol

**StarSeeds Protocol engineers and** **deploys** DeFi strategies, yield-generating smart contracts, and automated trading algorithms with the objectives of maximizing yield, principal protection and drawdown mitigation.\


**STARV3, a Tax-on-Transfer Token deployed to Polygon,** is designed to consistently increase STARV3â€™s liquidity, trade volume, and relative exchange rate to MATIC/ETH/BTC/USDC in all market conditions. \


**MATIC-S/USD-S/BTC-S DeFi Yield Derivative Tokens that** appreciate in value compared to the original, similar to MaticX and stMATIC. \
\
Unlike similar tokens,  S Tokens stake the original token into liquidity pools for usage in DEX trading. The compounded fees from protocol owned S-Token liquidity combined with a 0.08% tax on transfer fee increases the relative value over time of S tokens compared to the original tokens. \
\
\
**Automated Arbitrage Optimized Liquidity Pool Networks** that maximize trading volume & fees from combining specifically configured Balancer V2, DodoEX Stable, Quickswap V2, & Quickswap V3 liquidity pools.&#x20;
