# Introducing the StarSeeds Protocol

**StarSeeds Protocol engineers and** **deploys** DeFi strategies, yield-generating smart contracts, and automated trading algorithms with the objectives of maximizing yield, principal protection and drawdown mitigation.\
\
The primary technologies developed by the StarSeeds Protocol are;

1. **STARV4, an adjustable Tax-on-Transfer Token deployed to Polygon,** is designed to automatically increase in liquidity, trade volume, and relative exchange rate to MATIC/ETH/BTC/USDC in all market conditions. \

2. **MATIC-S/USD-S and other DeFi Yield Derivative Tokens that** appreciate in value compared to the original, similar to MaticX and stMATIC. \
   \
   Unlike similar tokens,  S Tokens stake the original token into liquidity pools for usage in DEX trading. The compounded fees from protocol owned S-Token liquidity combined with a 0.08% tax on transfer fee increases the relative value over time of S tokens relative to the underlying token. \

3. **Automated Arbitrage Optimized Liquidity Pool Networks** that maximize trading volume & fees from combining specifically configured Balancer V2, DodoEX Stable, Quickswap V2, & Quickswap V3.5 ALGEBRA liquidity pools. \

4. **Origin Relic Real Yield NFT's** that provide holders with a growing regenerative stream of tokens to holders that originate from STARV4 and S Token transfer fees that are automatically generated via arbitrage trading optimized liquidity pools.&#x20;
