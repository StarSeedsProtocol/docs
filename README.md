### â˜… **Additional Smart Contract Technologies Maintained by the StarSeeds Protocol**&#x20;

**1- Yield Derivative Tokens**&#x20;

**MATIC-SS/USD-SS** and Other DeFi Yield Derivative Tokens Appreciate in value continuously compared to the original, similar to MaticX and stMATIC.

Unlike similar yield derivative tokens that stake to secure the security of a chain, S Tokens stake the original token into liquidity pools for usage in DEX trading.

The compounded fees from protocol-owned S-Token liquidity combined with a 0.24% tax on transfer fee increase the relative value over time of SS tokens relative to the underlying token.

SS-Token contracts are generated by the DODOX token factory contract audited by Certik, Slowmist, and Peckshield.

LP contracts are generated by UNIV3, ALGEBRA V3.5, DODOX 2.0 Stableswap, Curve 2.0 Cryptoswap, and Balancer V2 weighted pool factory contracts audited by OpenZeppelin, Certora, Trail of Bits, CerTik, Sherlock, and other top agencies.

**2- Origin Relic Real Yield NFTs**

Provide holders with a growing regenerative stream of tokens that originate from STARV4 and STARGOV Token tax-on-transfer fees that are automatically generated via arbitrage trading optimized liquidity pools and then distributed through contracts generated GYSR V2 NFT token streaming factory contracts.

Each Relic distributes 1/10,000th of all StarSeeds Protocol Token Transfer taxes.

GYSR V2 contracts audited by Certik and other agencies.

Origin Relic NFT contract generated via HeyMint NFT factory contract factory audited by Zitgur.

**3- Liquidity-as-a-Service**&#x20;
