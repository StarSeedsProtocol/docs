# Introducing the StarSeeds Protocol

**StarSeeds Protocol** is a DeFi platform that connects users with high-yielding strategies, transforming volatility into revenue through a regenerative system of tax-on-transfer tokens, liquidity pools, and yield bearing NFTs.&#x20;

**STARV4, by StarSeeds Protocol** is an adaptive tax-on-transfer token designed to increase in value compared to the market. It maintains a growing exchange rate that is designed to outperform the market growth rates of BTC, ETH, and other mainstream tokens that it it paired with in Liquidity Pools.

**STARV4** is a DeFi token engineered to profit from market volatility, regardless of token prices rising or falling. All STARV4 enters circulation solely through liquidity pools, ensuring that 100% of STARV4 in circulation is backed by major market pairings like BTC, ETH, and USD. **This structure allows token-holders to earn fees from trading activities in any market condition.**

* **No ICO:** STARV4 didn’t have an initial coin offering; all STARV4 enters circulation solely via liquidity pools, which means 100% of STARV4 in circulation is backed by BTC/ETH/USD and other high-value tokens.
* **Adaptable Burn Tax:** STARV4 features an adaptive burn rate ranging from 0.04% to 2%, which reduces STARV4’s circulating supply and increases its relative exchange rate.
* **STARV4 Custom Liquidity Pool Network:** StarSeeds Protocol-owned liquidity pools permanently compound fees into backing STARV4, increasing its relative exchange rate.
* **Adaptive Liquidity Pool Fees:** Customized fees that adapt to current market conditions, which increase STARV4 liquidity pool fees, thereby increasing the backing and value of STARV4 tokens.
* **Concentrated Liquidity:** Provides over 10x higher returns compared to standard V2 Uniswap pools, which increases the liquidity backing STARV4 and thus increases STARV4’s exchange rate.
* **Operated by the StarSeeds Protocol DAO:** Earn SSG tokens on Tide by providing liquidity to STARV4 LPs or purchase SSG tokens and vote on the allocation of StarSeeds Protocol liquidity.

#### Other Smart Contract Technologies Maintained by the StarSeeds Protocol

**MATIC-SS/USD-SS and Other DeFi Yield Derivative Tokens**

* Appreciate in value continuously compared to the original, similar to MaticX and stMATIC.
* Unlike similar yield derivative tokens that stake to secure the security of a chain, S Tokens stake the original token into liquidity pools for usage in DEX trading.
* The compounded fees from protocol-owned S-Token liquidity combined with a 0.24% tax on transfer fee increase the relative value over time of SS tokens relative to the underlying token.
* SS-Token contracts are generated by the DODOX token factory contract audited by Certik, Slowmist, and Peckshield.

**Automated Arbitrage Optimized Liquidity Pool Networks**

* Increase trading volume & fees by more than 10 times compared to standard UNIV2 Liquidity.
* LP contracts are generated by UNIV3, ALGEBRA V3.5, DODOX 2.0 Stableswap, Curve 2.0 Cryptoswap, and Balancer V2 weighted pool factory contracts audited by OpenZeppelin, Certora, Trail of Bits, CerTik, Sherlock, and other top agencies.

**Origin Relic Real Yield NFTs**

* Provide holders with a growing regenerative stream of tokens that originate from STARV4 and S Token tax-on-transfer fees that are automatically generated via arbitrage trading optimized liquidity pools and then distributed through contracts generated by Flair V1 and GYSR V2 NFT token streaming factory contracts.
* Each Tier 1 Relic distributes 1/1000th of all StarSeeds Protocol Token Transfer taxes.
* GYSR V2 contracts audited by Certik and other agencies.
* Origin Relic NFT contract generated via HeyMint NFT factory contract factory audited by Zitgur.

**Liquidity-as-a-Service:**

* Up to $100K in STARV4 liquidity for approved protocols.
* Fees are permanently compounded, providing growing buying pressure and trade volume.
