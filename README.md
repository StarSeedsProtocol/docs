# Introducing the StarSeeds Protocol

**StarSeeds Protocol engineers, customizes and** **deploys** DeFi strategies, smart contracts, and automated trading algorithms with the objectives of maximizing yield, principal protection, security and drawdown mitigation.\
\
The primary technologies optimized and maintained by the StarSeeds Protocol are;

1. **STARV4, an adjustable Tax-on-Transfer Token generated by the BitBond Factory Contract Audited by Certik and deployed to Polygon,** is designed to automatically increase in liquidity, trade volume, and relative exchange rate to MATIC/ETH/BTC/USDC in all market conditions. \

2. **MATIC-S/USD-S and other DeFi Yield Derivative Tokens** generated by the Dodoex token factory contract audited by Certik, Slowmist, and Peckshield that appreciate in value compared to the original, similar to MaticX and stMATIC. \
   \
   Unlike similar tokens, S Tokens stake the original token into liquidity pools for usage in DEX trading. The compounded fees from protocol owned S-Token liquidity combined with a 0.08% tax on transfer fee increase the relative value over time of S tokens relative to the underlying token. \

3. **Automated Arbitrage Optimized Liquidity Pool Networks** deployed via UNIV2, UNIV3, ALGEBRA V3.5, DodoEX 2.0 Stableswap, Curve 2.0 Cryptoswap, and Balancer V2 Weighted Pool Factory generating contracts audited by OpenZeppelin, Certora, Trail of Bits, CerTik, Sherlock and other top agencies that maximize trading volume & fees.\

4. **Origin Relic Real Yield NFT's** deployed via HeyMint NFT Factory Contract generator audited by Zitgur that provide holders with a growing regenerative stream of tokens to holders that originate from STARV4 and S Token transfer fees that are automatically generated via arbitrage trading optimized liquidity pools and then distributed via Flair V1 and GYSR V2 NFT Holder Token Streaming Contract Factory Generators audited by Certik and others.&#x20;
