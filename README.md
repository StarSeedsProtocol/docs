# Astral Programmatic Yield Tokens

Astral Programmatic Yield Tokens feature customizable revenue distribution parameters for how yield generated by the underlying tokens is used.\
\
This means Protocols and Token Creators that deploy Astral Yield Tokens choose how the yield from their Astral derivative tokens is utilized. Yield from Astral tokens (even those deposited in liquidity pools and other smart contracts) can be routed into various programmatic functions, such as:

* Swapping tokens to convert yield tokens into other kinds of tokens.<br>
* Depositing into other pools or contracts for deepening Protocol-Owned or Permanent liquidity supplies.<br>
* Funding staking contracts to reward stakers<br>
* Sending reflection payments directly to token holders<br>
* Depositing to Treasuries for protocol-owned assets<br>
* Compounding back into the underlying token’s value (for example, to create a wrapped derivative token that that increases in value over time compared to the underlying tokens.<br>
* Complex transactions and execute any other transactional command for example applying it to any protocol. Can be integrated with existing defi technologies/systems



Currently, Astral Yield Tokens are being developed on a case-by-case basis, in the future, a no-code interface and Factory Contracts will enable anyone to deploy a new Astral Programmatic Yield Token Wrapper for any existing ERC20 token.
