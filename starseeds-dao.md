#### Liquidity Reserve Management by StarSeeds DAO

**Council of Expert Traders:**

The StarSeeds Protocol DAO has a council of expert traders responsible for managing and optimizing the protocol’s Treasury. These seasoned traders leverage their expertise to ensure efficient allocation and growth of assets, thereby strengthening the protocol’s financial foundation.

**Strategic Allocation:**

The council strategically allocates liquidity reserves to various assets and investment opportunities. This includes optimizing trading portfolios, maximizing returns, and minimizing risks through innovative strategies and advanced trading techniques.

#### Community-Driven Governance

StarSeeds Protocol advocates for decentralized governance, with improvement proposals initiated through discussions and feedback from all token holders within the community. These proposals, known as StarSeeds Improvement Proposals (SIPs), are presented and voted on via the StarSeeds Snapshot Portal. **No more than 5% SSG can be added in a single proposal.**

**Governance:**

StarSeeds Protocol is entirely decentralized, functioning under a DAO-based framework. This allows SSG token holders to participate in voting on governance proposals introduced by the StarSeeds team, giving them influence over the protocol’s future. Check out the StarSeeds Snapshot page to review previous proposals, votes, and outcomes: \[[StarSeeds Snapshot Portal](https://snapshot.org/#/starseeds-dao.eth)].

Each proposal initiates with a formal governance discussion on the StarSeeds Discord. After the community has had the chance to exchange their views with each other and the StarSeeds team, the discussion advances to a formal governance vote where SSG holders can cast their ballots.

By integrating these elements, the StarSeeds Protocol is poised to make substantial contributions to its domain, fostering innovation and sustainable growth. This approach ensures that the liquidity reserves are managed effectively, benefiting both the protocol and its community.
