# Astral Token DAO- Aragon

### Astral Token DAO Governance

The Astral Token DAO employs a decentralized governance model using the $ASTRAL token on the Polygon network. This governance structure allows token holders to participate in decision-making processes that shape the future of the StarSeeds Protocol (soon to be Astral Protocol).

### Governance Token

* **Token:** $ASTRAL
* **Total Supply:** 41,000 $ASTRAL
* **Voting Power:** 1 $ASTRAL = 1 vote

### Governance Parameters

* **Quorum Requirement:** 40% of total token supply (16,400 $ASTRAL)

### Governance Process

1. **Proposal Submission:** Proposals are submitted to the DAO for consideration.
2. **Voting:** Token holders cast votes on active proposals.
3. **Execution:** If quorum is met and the proposal passes, it becomes eligible for execution.

### Participating in Governance

Token holders can participate in governance by:

* Submitting proposals
* Voting on active proposals
* Delegating voting power to other addresses
