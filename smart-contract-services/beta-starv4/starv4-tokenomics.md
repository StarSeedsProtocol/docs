# STARV4 Tokenomics

## 25% of STARV4's Max Supply was initially vested in a 4 year linear contract which distributes to StarSeeds Protocol's founding team and seed investors. &#x20;

\
**The majority of founding team tokens are being continually reinvested into the StarSeeds Protocol ecosystem in the form of:**

1. Swapping STARV4 to SSG & SSG+ and hodling to earn voting yield while securing the DAO Treasury
2. Converting STARV4 to V4 Origin Relics which are staked to earn a share of 80% of all StarSeeds Protocol's generated Tax-on-Transfer fees + 10% of the SSG supply.

STARV4 used to mint V4 Origin Relics and swap for SSG and SSG+ do not decrease the value of or liquidity for STARV4.

## 75% of the Max supply of STARV4 was initially held in the StarSeeds Protocol's Treasury. Treasury held STARV4 is considered locked and is unlockable under three circumstances:

1. When STARV4 is paired with non-native tokens generated from the StarSeeds Protocol's external treasury and deposited into StarSeeds Protocol-owned liquidity pools.
2. When a Liquidity-as-a-Service Proposal is passed, STARV4 is paired with the approved token and deposited into StarSeeds Protocol-owned liquidity pools.
3. When StarSeeds Protocol-owned concentrated liquidity pools become off-centered towards the side of having too little STARV4, new concentrated liquidity pools with additional STARV4 from the Treasury are created.

To summarize, the only time that STARV4 exits the StarSeeds Protocol Treasury is when it is deposited into StarSeeds Protocol-owned liquidity pools. All user-held STARV4 tokens enter circulation only when swapping for STARV4 from a DEX liquidity pool.
