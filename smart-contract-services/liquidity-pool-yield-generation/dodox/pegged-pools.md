# Pegged Pools

Pegged Pools are a specialized type of pool that use the PMM algorithm to maintain a specific ratio between assets, often used to facilitate trading between stablecoins or tokens with a fixed exchange rate. These pools offer:

* Reduced slippage for assets with a known parity.
* Optimized liquidity allocation around the pegged price point.
