# Single Sided Pools

Single-sided pools allow liquidity providers to contribute only one type of token rather than a pair. This removes the need for liquidity providers to maintain a balanced portfolio of assets and minimizes exposure to impermanent loss. Single-sided pools are particularly attractive for:

* New entrants with limited token diversity.
* Protocols seeking to reduce barriers for liquidity contributors.
