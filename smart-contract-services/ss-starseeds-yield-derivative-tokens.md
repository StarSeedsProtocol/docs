# SS - StarSeeds Yield Derivative Tokens

Similar to stMATIC and wstETH, SS tokens are pegged to the value of original token in such a way that makes each unit of S-token worth more than the original token over time.

Unlike other yield-bearing tokens, SS tokens do not represent MATIC/ETH that has been staked to increase the security of the Polygon Network. \
\
Rather, SS tokens are tokens automatically deployed in a network of liquidity pools that facilitate automated arbitrage trades in such a way that creates regular and growing trade volume.

With every swap executed with SS tokens, SS tokens become more valuable compared to the underlying token due to the 0.24% transfer fee on SS tokens reducing their supply combined with permanently compounded StarSeeds Protocol-owned liquidity pool swap fees increasing the amount of backing each SS token has. \
