# STARV4 Tokenomics

STARV4 initial Supply: 10,000,000. \
\
STARV4 Initial Distribution: \
500,000 for StarSeeds Founding Team, 4 year linear vest from 8/28/2024. \
Remaining 9,500,000 Tokens held in StarSeeds Protocol Treasury. \
\
STARV4 in the StarSeeds Protocol's Treasury is considered locked, and is only unlocked under one of four circumstances.\
\
1\. When STARV4 is paired with non-native tokens generated from the StarSeeds Protocol's External Treasury or Reserve Function, and deposited into StarSeeds Protocol owned liquidity pools. \
\
2\. When STARV4 is sold via DEX aggregator in accordance with the parameters of the Reserve Function, with the tokens from the sale of STARV4 being paired to STARV4 and deposited into StarSeeds Protocol owned liquidity pools.\
\
3\. When a Liquidity-as-a-Service Proposal is passed, STARV4 is paired to another Protocols token and deposited into StarSeeds Protocol owned liquidity pools. \
\
4\. When StarSeeds Protocol owned concentrated liquidity pools become off-centered towards the side of having too little STARV4, new concentrated liquidity pools with additional STARV4 from the Treasury are created. \
\
To summerize, the only time that STARV4 exits the StarSeeds Protocol Treasury is when it is deposited into StarSeeds Protocol owned liquidity pools.&#x20;
