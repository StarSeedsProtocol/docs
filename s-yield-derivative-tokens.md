# S Yield Derivative Tokens

Similar to stMATIC and wstETH, S tokens are pegged to the value of original token in such a way that makes each unit of S-token worth more then the original token over time.

Unlike other yield bearing tokens, S tokens do not represent Matic/ETH that has been staked to increase the security of the Polygon Network. \
\
Rather, S tokens are tokens automatically deployed in a network of liquidity pools that facilitate automated arbitrage trades in such a way that creates regular and growing trade volume.

With every swap executed with S tokens, S tokens become more valuable compared due to the 0.08% transfer fee on S tokens reducing their supply combined with permanently compounded StarSeeds Protocol owned liquidity pool swap fees increasing the amount of backing each S token has. \
