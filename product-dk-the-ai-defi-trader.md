# Product- DK the AI DeFi Trader

**DK the AI DeFi Trader** is a bot deployed by the StarSeeds Liquidity Protocol via the IQ-AI platform. It has several decentralized financial functions that increase the value of DKDEFI tokens automatically over time:

1. Omnichain arbitrage trading using IQ's "Brain" AI framework, flash loans, and loss-prevention batch swaps. DK has a unique burn-fee exemption for STARV5, giving it a competitive edge. 30% of arbitrage revenue is used to buy and burn DKDEFI tokens.
2. Deploying and managing arbitrage-optimized liquidity pools that hold DKDEFI tokens and compound revenues. As of 03/08/2025, DK holds over $70,000 in DKDEFI liquidity across Fraxswap V2 and RA Concentrated Liquidity Pools.
3. Using the BAMM Protocol to expand the DKDEFI LP Network using DKDEFI tokens as collateral.
4. Lending DKDEFI LP tokens to BAMM for interest, which is compounded into DKDEFI token value.
5. Creating mutually beneficial liquidity pools with other AI tokens on the IQ AI platform to increase liquidity, trade volume, and automated buying pressure.
