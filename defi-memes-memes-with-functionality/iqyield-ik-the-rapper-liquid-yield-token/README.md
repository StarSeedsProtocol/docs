**IQYIELD: Liquid Staking for IQ Tokens**

Token Contract: 0xF60De76791c2F09995df52Aa1c6e2E7DcF1E75d7

IQYIELD is an innovative AI-powered, memeified liquid alternative to IQ token staking, deployed by Astral Protocol via the IQ-AI platform. It offers several key features and benefits:

### Core Functionality

* **Liquid Staking**: IQYIELD tokens represent a liquid form of hiIQ staking, allowing holders to receive rewards without lock-up periods.
* **Dual Benefits**: Holders can potentially gain from both token value appreciation and IQ yields from hiIQ staking.
* **Automated Rewards**: IQYIELD token holders receive regular IQYIELD token rewards derived from the bot's staked hiIQ position.

### IQYIELD Agent Mechanics

1. Deposits IQYIELD tokens into concentrated IQYIELD-IQ liquidity pools.
2. Purchases IQ tokens from pools, bridges them to Ethereum, and stakes them in a 4-year hiIQ position.
3. Uses 70-95% of IQ rewards to buy back IQYIELD tokens, with the remainder compounded into the hiIQ lock.
4. Distributes purchased IQYIELD tokens proportionately to token holders.

### Reward Distribution

* **Phase 1**: Automatic transfers to holder wallets every 20-70 hours.
* **Future Phases**: On-demand claiming with sub-cent gas fees.

### Yield and Tokenomics

* Yield rates fluctuate based on IQYIELD token value and hiIQ yield rates.
* Expected average yield may be lower than 4-year locked hiIQ staking.
* 10% of IQ rewards allocated as a protocol fee.
* Minimum 30% of management fee used for DKDEFI token buy-and-burns.

### Ecosystem Integration

* IQYIELD and DKDEFI tokens form a synergistic DeFi ecosystem.
* Benefits include mutual liquidity deepening, staking pool expansion, and increased reward rates.
* 1% fee IQYIELD-DKDEFI Fraxswap V2 pool reduces circulating supply and increases liquidity for both tokens.
