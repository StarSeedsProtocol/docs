# Overview of IQ AI

### Overview of IQ AI

IQ AI is a decentralized platform that combines artificial intelligence (AI) with blockchain technology to create autonomous agents for decentralized finance (DeFi). Its core component, the **Agent Tokenization Platform (ATP)**, enables the tokenization of AI models, allowing them to autonomously manage assets, execute financial strategies, and interact with decentralized ecosystems.

### Why StarSeeds Protocol Builds on IQ AI

StarSeeds Protocol has integrated with IQ AI due to its innovative capabilities:

* **Autonomy**: Agents operate independently without centralized oversight.
* **Tokenization**: Each agent issues its own token, representing governance, value, and functionality.
* **Cross-Chain Integration**: Seamless interoperability across Fraxtal, NEAR Protocol, Ethereum, Polygon, and Binance Smart Chain.
* **Immediate Liquidity**: Agent tokens are paired with IQ tokens upon launch for instant liquidity and lending markets.

StarSeeds Protocol has successfully launched two agents on IQ AI:

1. **IQYIELD**: A liquid alternative to IQ staking with automated reward systems.\
