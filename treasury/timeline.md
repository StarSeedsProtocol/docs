# Timeline

## StarSeeds Protocol Roadmap

StarSeeds Protocol is developing numerous upgrades to increase protocol revenue and the value of STARV4, including:

1. **Bridge STARV4 to Additional Chains:**
   * Expand STARV4's presence to more blockchain networks to increase accessibility and liquidity.
2. **Add StarSeeds Owned Arbitrage Bots with Gains Compounded into STARV4:**
   * Deploy arbitrage bots to capitalize on price discrepancies across exchanges, with profits reinvested into STARV4. This will enhance liquidity and trading volume, benefiting STARV4 holders.
3. **Automate StarSeeds DAO Voting Rewards:**
   * Implement automated reward distribution for DAO voting participants to encourage governance engagement and ensure timely and accurate rewards.
4. **On-Chain AI “Agent” Driven Strategy Integrations:**
   * Use AI-driven agents to execute transactions based on live chain data, optimizing trading strategies and adapting to market dynamics in real-time.
5. **Deploy STARV4 Arbitrage Rebate NFT Program:**
   * Launch an NFT program offering rebates for arbitrage activities. This arbitrage license allows bots to get ahead of others in trading STARV4 by recouping part of the burn on transfer fee.
6. **On-Chain Real-Time STARV4 Burn Fee Modulator:**
   * Develop a dynamic fee modulator to adjust STARV4's burn rate in real-time based on network conditions, decreasing the circulating and max supply of STARV4.
7. **V2 wstBAL and wstEXTRA:**
   * Add fully-audited on-chain automation to wstBAL and wstEXTRA V1.
8. **Protocol-to-Protocol Tokenization and Liquidity Optimization Automation:**
   * Automate services that tokenize assets and optimize liquidity across protocols, improving efficiency and reducing manual intervention.
9. **StarSeeds DEX:**
   * Create a decentralized exchange combining features from Uniswap, Curve, Balancer, and others to provide a comprehensive trading platform. The DEX will offer StarSeeds Protocol liquidity-as-a-service for other protocols and the capacity to leverage liquidity positions built on our DEX.
10. **StarSeeds Chain:**
    * Develop a blockchain on Polygon's stack to support the StarSeeds DEX, focusing on interchain liquidity and arbitrage control. Use the StarSeeds block sequencer to manage arbitrage trading, with profits compounded into STARV4 and burning the base STARV4 fee for transactions.
11. **AI Optimized StarSeeds Protocol Treasury Management:**
    * Integrating AI to optimize the management of the protocol's treasury, ensuring efficient allocation and growth of assets, maximizing returns, and contributing to the protocol's financial health.
